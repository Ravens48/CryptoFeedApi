# CryptoFeedApi

CryptoFeedApi is a wrapper using coingeckoApi.
CryptoFeedApi offer you the possibility of create/connect to an account and save cryptos to favourites, using mongoDB as database..

### What I learn doing this application
- Nodejs architecture
- MongoDB
- Implement JWT
- Connect to an external API

#### Utils

To run the project :
- clone the project
- docker compose up -> create database called api_db with user and password, you can find and change it in *.env* file. (Maybe I will fix this step to not create databse manually)
- down an reup docker compose. 
- API is now connected to databse and fully fonctionnal, have fun.
